eslint-tester
=============

**DEPRECATED:** ESLint Tester has been deprecated and is no longer in active development as of ESLint v1.0.0. It has been replaced by the `RuleTester` in the `eslint` package. See the [1.0.0 migration guide](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/migrating-to-1.0.0) for more details.

A testing utility for ESLint. At the moment, used primarily for testing within ESLint project. We'll continue working on it to expand its usefulness to those writing custom rules as well.
